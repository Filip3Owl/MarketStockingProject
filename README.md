# 📊 Market Data & Web Scraping Project

This project focuses on collecting and analyzing market data. It uses `yfinance` to fetch financial information and web scraping techniques (with libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`) to extract data directly from web pages.

## 🚀 How It Works

This project combines two main approaches to gather comprehensive market insights:

1.  ### **Financial Data Collection (via `yfinance`)**
    We use `yfinance` to tap into Yahoo Finance, allowing us to easily retrieve historical stock data, financial statements, and other key metrics for companies or indices. This provides a structured and reliable source for financial numbers.

2.  ### **Web Scraping (via `requests` & `BeautifulSoup`)**
    For data not readily available through APIs, we employ web scraping. This involves:
    * **Fetching Web Pages:** Using the `requests` library to download the raw HTML content of web pages.
    * **Parsing HTML:** Employing `BeautifulSoup` to navigate and extract specific pieces of information (like data from tables or text from articles) from the raw HTML structure.

The collected data is then processed and organized for analysis, leading to insights about the market.

## ⚙️ Get Started

Here's how to set up and run this project on your machine:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
    cd your-project-name
    ```
    (Remember to replace `your-username` and `your-project-name` with your actual GitHub details.)

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended for managing dependencies):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (You'll need a `requirements.txt` file listing your project's dependencies, such as `yfinance`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `pandas`, `lxml` etc.)

### Run the Project

Execute your main script to start the data collection and analysis:

```bash
python main.py
```
(Assuming your primary script is named `main.py`.)
